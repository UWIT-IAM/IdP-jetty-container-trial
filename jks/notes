Generate a pkcs12 from a cert and key

  (mkp12)
  openssl pkcs12 -export -out idp.p12 -inkey idp.key -in idp.crt

  You don't have to supply a password here, but you do when creating a jks.  It's convenient just to use the same simple passwor dthroughout.

Look at a pkcs12 certificate

  (e.g.)
  openssl pkcs12 -in idp.p12 -nodes | openssl x509 -noout -dates -subject


Create a jks file from a pkcs12

  (mkjks)  it 'fixes' a jks I think.  Can also just delete the original. the following will create it.
  keytool -v -importkeystore -srckeystore idp.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -destkeystore idp.jks -deststoretype JKS

  Note that you have to supply a password at this step.


List certs in a keystore

  keytool -list -keystore idp.jks

List details of a cert in the keystore

  If you didn't specify an alias the 'name' is basically the sequence number.  First item in the above list.
 
  keytool -export -keystore idp.jks -file z -alias 1 | openssl x509 -inform der -text
